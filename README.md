# SVM Classification Project

This project explores the application of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to classify data in a machine learning context. The Jupyter notebook `3.1-Classification-SVMs-1.ipynb` provides a comprehensive guide through the process, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## Features

- Detailed explanation of SVM concepts.
- Data preprocessing techniques specific to SVM requirements.
- Training SVM models using Scikit-learn.
- Evaluation of model performance with various metrics.

## Installation

To run this notebook, you need to have Python and Jupyter installed on your machine. Additionally, you will need the following libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
